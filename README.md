# Graphics_openGl_FlappyBird
This is a simplified version of the famous Flappy Bird game. The main idea of the game is that there is a player (bird) flying continuously trying to avoid colliding with barriers whilst also not falling out of the screen for the longest time.

In this version of the game, the player can also collect a power up that would help them advance through the game.
Moreover, the player has 3 lives, each is lost on every collision with the barriers. The game ends if the player passes out of the bottom or the top borders of the scene or if the player collides with the barriers 3 times losing the 3 lives the player should have.

Instructions: 
- Run the game through Opengltemplate.cpp file. 
- Use the 'a' key to make the bird jump.
